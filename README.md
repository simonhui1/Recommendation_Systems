# Recommendation Systems Project

## Overview of Business Problem

The goal of this project is to provide a functioning recommendation system, as well as several actionable insights, for a startup movie streaming service. 

## Understanding the Data Source

The data comes from [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/), a dynamic dataset that contains 100,000 movie ratings generated by 600 users across 9,000 users.

## Data Limitations

Superusers were a significant limiting factor when it came to our initial data analysis because some of them accounted for a significant amount of reviews per user. See below:

Here we see that most users rated at most 250 movies, whereas a subset of superusers have rated anywhere between 1750 to 2750 movies per superuser.

## Data Analysis

Some general insights:

We find that a majority of movie ratings given in this dataset were to movies between the 1980s to the early 2000s.

Ratings for each of the top 5 movie genres are slightly skewed, revealing the median rating to be somewhere between 3.5 and 4 for every of the listed genres.

However, some movies will be more popular than others, regardless of genre. Here we identify the top 20 most rated movies in the dataset.

## Modelling Process

The predictive model that serve as the basis of our recommendation system accounts for new users/soon-to-be existing and already-existing users as well. More specifically:

* To address the "cold start problem", we tested the Pearson Correlation Coefficient
* To address new users with minimal movie-rating information, we tested a KNNBasic model as well as an SVD model

## Conclusions and Future Insights

Based on MAE scores (regression metric) received from the aforementioned models, we commit to the SVD model as our final model. Further business recommendations are:
* Change UI to have movie recommendations near the top of the homepage.
* Include feedback survery icons to ultimately gain insight on the performance of the movie recommendations
* Include cast information to diversify future movie recommendations

Going forward, it is in our best interest to investigate the potential effects of using different devices to interact with the platform.
