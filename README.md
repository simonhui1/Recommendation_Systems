# Recommendation Systems Project

## Overview of Business Problem

The goal of this project is to provide a functioning recommendation system, as well as several actionable insights, for a startup movie streaming service. 

## Understanding the Data Source

The data comes from [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/), a dynamic dataset that contains 100,000 movie ratings generated by 600 users across 9,000 users.

## Data Limitations

Superusers were a significant limiting factor when it came to our initial data analysis because some of them accounted for a significant amount of reviews per user. See below:

Here we see that most users rated at most 250 movies, whereas a subset of superusers have rated anywhere between 1750 to 2750 movies per superuser.
